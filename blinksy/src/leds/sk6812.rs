///

///
/// - [`ClocklessDriver`](crate::driver::ClocklessDriver)
///
/// ## Key Features
///
/// - Single-wire [clockless protocol](crate::driver::clockless) (data only, no clock)
/// - 32-bit color (8 bits per channel, 4 channels)

/// ## Protocol Details
///
/// The SK6812 protocol uses precise timing of pulses on a single data line:
///
/// - A '0' bit is represented by a short high pulse (~300ns) followed by a long low pulse (~900ns)
/// - A '1' bit is represented by a long high pulse (~600ns) followed by a long low pulse (~600ns)
/// - After sending all bits, a reset pulse of at least 80µs is required
///
/// (References: [Datasheet](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/product-files/2757/p2757_SK6812RGBW_REV01.pdf))
///
/// Each LED receives 32 bits (RGBW) and then passes subsequent data to the next LED in the chain.
