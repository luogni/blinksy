/// # WS2812 (NeoPixel) LEDs
///
/// This type describes the WS2812 (NeoPixel) LEDs, which are widely used due to their
/// simplicity and low cost.
///
/// # Driver
///
/// - [`ClocklessDriver`](crate::driver::ClocklessDriver)
///
/// ## Key Features
///
/// - Single-wire [clockless protocol](crate::driver::clockless) (data only, no clock)
/// - 24-bit color (8 bits per channel, 3 channels)
/// - Fixed update rate: 30μs per pixel

/// ## Protocol Details
///
/// The WS2812 protocol uses precise timing of pulses on a single data line:
///
/// - A '0' bit is represented by a short high pulse (~400ns) followed by a long low pulse (~850ns)
/// - A '1' bit is represented by a long high pulse (~800ns) followed by a short low pulse (~450ns)
/// - After sending all bits, a reset pulse of at least 50µs is required
///
/// (References: [Datasheet](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/WS2812B.pdf))
///
/// Each LED receives 24 bits (RGB) and then passes subsequent data to the next LED in the chain.
