//! # Driver Interface
//!
//! A driver is what tells the LED hardware how to be the colors you want.
//!
//! ## Core traits
//!
//! - [`Driver`]: For all blocking drivers
//! - [`DriverAsync`]: For all async drivers
//!
//! ## Re-usable implementations
//!
//! - [`clocked`]: For clocked (two-wire) protocols (like [`APA102`](crate::leds::Apa102))
//! - [`clockless`]: For clockless (one-wire) protocols (like [`WS2812`](crate::leds::Ws2812))
