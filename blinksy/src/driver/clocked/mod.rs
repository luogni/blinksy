//! # Clocked LED Driver Abstractions
//!
//! This module provides abstractions for driving "clocked" LED protocols, such as
//! APA102 (DotStar), SK9822, and similar. These protocols are based on
//! [SPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface), where chipsets
//! have a data line and a clock line.
//!
//! ## Clocked Protocols
//!
//! Unlike clockless protocols, clocked protocols:
//!
//! - Use separate data and clock lines
//! - Don't rely on precise timing (only clock frequency matters)
//! - Often provide more control over brightness and color precision
//! - Can work with hardware SPI peripherals
//!
//! ## Traits
//!
//! - [`ClockedLed`]: Trait defining protocol specifics for a clocked LED chipset
//! - [`ClockedLedAsync`]: Trait defining protocol specifics for a clocked LED chipset, asynchronously
//! - [`ClockedWriter`]: Trait for how to write data for a clocked protocol
//! - [`ClockedWriterAsync`]: Trait for how to write data for a clocked protocol, asynchronously
//!
//! ## Drivers
//!
//! - [`ClockedDelayDriver`]: Driver using GPIO bit-banging with a delay timer
//! - [`ClockedSpiDriver`]: (Recommended) Driver using a hardware SPI peripheral
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! ```rust
//! use blinksy::{color::{ColorCorrection, FromColor, LedRgb, LinearSrgb}, driver::{ClockedLed, ClockedWriter}};
//!
//! // Define a new LED chipset with specific protocol requirements
//! struct MyLed;
//!
//! impl ClockedLed for MyLed {
//!     type Word = u8;
//!     type Color = LinearSrgb;
//!
//!     fn start<W: ClockedWriter<Word = Self::Word>>(writer: &mut W) -> Result<(), W::Error> {
//!         // Write start frame
//!         writer.write(&[0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00])
//!     }
//!
//!     fn color<W: ClockedWriter<Word = Self::Word>>(
//!         writer: &mut W,
//!         color: Self::Color,
//!         brightness: f32,
//!         correction: ColorCorrection,
//!     ) -> Result<(), W::Error> {
//!         // Write color data for one LED
//!         let linear_srgb = LinearSrgb::from_color(color);
//!         let rgb = LedRgb::from_linear_srgb(linear_srgb, brightness, correction);
//!         writer.write(&[0x80, rgb[0], rgb[1], rgb[2]])
//!     }
//!
//!     fn end<W: ClockedWriter<Word = Self::Word>>(writer: &mut W, _: usize) -> Result<(), W::Error> {
//!         // Write end frame
//!         writer.write(&[0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF])
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
