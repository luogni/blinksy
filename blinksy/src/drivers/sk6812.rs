//! # SK6812 LED Driver
//!
//! This module provides driver support for SK6812 LEDs, which use a
//! single-wire, timing-sensitive protocol similar to [`super::ws2812`].
//!
//! # Drivers
//!
//! - [`Sk6812Delay`]: Uses bit-banged GPIO
//! - [`blinksy-esp::Sk6812Rmt`]: On ESP devices, uses RMT peripheral
//!
//! ## Key Features
//!
//! - Single-wire protocol (data only, no clock)
//! - 32-bit color (8 bits per channel)
//! - Timing-sensitive protocol
//!
//! ## Protocol Details
//!
//! The SK6812 protocol uses precise timing of pulses on a single data line:
//!
//! - A '0' bit is represented by a short high pulse (~300ns) followed by a long low pulse (~900ns)
//! - A '1' bit is represented by a long high pulse (~600ns) followed by a long low pulse (~600ns)
//! - After sending all bits, a reset pulse of at least 80µs is required
//!
//! (References: [Datasheet](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/product-files/2757/p2757_SK6812RGBW_REV01.pdf))
//!
//! Each LED receives 32 bits (RGBW) and then passes subsequent data to the next LED in the chain.
//!
