## UNRELEASED

Migration guide (0.10 -> UNRELEASED)

- `ControlBuilder::with_layout` generic type signature changes from `<Layout`> to `<Layout, const PIXEL_COUNT: usize>`
  - If your layout is `Layout`, then change `.with_layout<Layout>()` to `.with_layout::<Layout, { Layout::PIXEL_COUNT }>()`

```diff
-  .with_layout::<Layout>()
+  .with_layout::<Layout, { Layout::PIXEL_COUNT }>()
```

- `ControlBuilder` now has a `with_frame_buffer_size` to provide a `FRAME_BUFFER_SIZE` constant.
  - So for example, to build a frame buffer to drive Ws2812 LEDs:

```diff
+  .with_frame_buffer_size::<{ Ws2812::frame_buffer_size(Layout::PIXEL_COUNT) }>()
```

If using the `gledopto` high-level helper macros, this should be all you need to change.

Below are changes for lower-level interfaces:

- Change `Driver` (and `DriverAsync`) traits:

```rust
pub trait Driver {
    /// The error type that may be returned by the driver.
    type Error;

    /// The color type accepted by the driver.
    type Color;

    /// The word of the frame buffer.
    type Word;

    /// Encodes an update frame buffer for the LED hardware.
    ///
    /// # Type Parameters
    ///
    /// * `PIXEL_COUNT` - Number of pixels in frame
    /// * `FRAME_BUFFER_SIZE` - Length of encoded frame buffer, in words.
    /// * `Pixels` - Iterator of colors for each pixel
    /// * `Color` - Type of each pixel
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    ///
    /// * `pixels` - Iterator of colors for each pixel
    /// * `brightness` - Global brightness scaling factor (0.0 to 1.0)
    /// * `correction` - Color correction factors
    ///
    /// # Returns
    ///
    /// Result with frame buffer
    fn encode<const PIXEL_COUNT: usize, const FRAME_BUFFER_SIZE: usize, Pixels, Color>(
        &mut self,
        pixels: Pixels,
        brightness: f32,
        correction: ColorCorrection,
    ) -> Vec<Self::Word, FRAME_BUFFER_SIZE>
    where
        Pixels: IntoIterator<Item = Color>,
        Self::Color: FromColor<Color>;

    /// Writes frame buffer to the LED hardware.
    ///
    /// # Type Parameters
    ///
    /// * `FRAME_BUFFER_SIZE` - Length of encoded frame buffer, in words.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    ///
    /// * `frame` - Frame buffer
    ///
    /// # Returns
    ///
    /// Result indicating success or an error
    fn write<const FRAME_BUFFER_SIZE: usize>(
        &mut self,
        frame: Vec<Self::Word, FRAME_BUFFER_SIZE>,
        brightness: f32,
        correction: ColorCorrection,
    ) -> Result<(), Self::Error>;

    /// Shows a frame on the LED hardware.
    ///
    /// # Type Parameters
    ///
    /// * `PIXEL_COUNT` - Number of pixels in frame
    /// * `FRAME_BUFFER_SIZE` - Length of encoded frame buffer, in words.
    /// * `Pixels` - Iterator of colors for each pixel
    /// * `Color` - Type of each pixel
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    ///
    /// * `pixels` - Iterator of colors for each pixel
    /// * `brightness` - Global brightness scaling factor (0.0 to 1.0)
    /// * `correction` - Color correction factors
    ///
    /// # Returns
    ///
    /// Result indicating success or an error
    fn show<const PIXEL_COUNT: usize, const FRAME_BUFFER_SIZE: usize, I, C>(
        &mut self,
        pixels: I,
        brightness: f32,
        correction: ColorCorrection,
    ) -> Result<(), Self::Error>
    where
        I: IntoIterator<Item = C>,
        Self::Color: FromColor<C>,
    {
        let frame_buffer =
            self.encode::<PIXEL_COUNT, FRAME_BUFFER_SIZE, _, _>(pixels, brightness, correction);
        self.write(frame_buffer, brightness, correction)
    }
}
```

- Until  [the `generic_const_exprs` feature](https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/unstable-book/language-features/generic-const-exprs.html) is stable, we aren't able to use associated constants, const functions, or expressions in the Blinksy code to calculate constants at compile-time. Instead, we must receive pre-calculated constants from the user as a generic. The best we can do is make it easy as possible by providing good types, traits, and const functions for the user to use.
- Built-in LED drivers have been refactored:
  - There is a generic driver for each type: `ClocklessDriver` and `ClockedDriver`.
  - You construct the generic driver by combining an Led with a Writer, both of that type.
  - All drivers and all writers are made through the builder pattern.
  - So for example: the clockless RMT driver for a WS2812 LED:

```rust
let driver = ClocklessDriver::default()
    .with_led::<Ws2812>()
    .with_writer(ClocklessRmt::default()
        .with_led::<Ws2812>()
        .with_rmt_buffer_size::<{ rmt_buffer_size::<Ws2812>(Layout::PIXEL_COUNT) }>()
        .with_channel(/* rmt channel */)
        .with_pin(/* rmt pin */)
        .build()
    );
```

  - Another example: the clocked SPI driver for an APA102 LED:

```rust
let driver = ClockedDriver::default()
    .with_led::<Apa102>()
    .with_writer(/* spi bus */)
```

- Clockless and clocked writers are also constructed through the builder pattern.
- Move LED definitions to `blinksy::leds` module, remove `Led` suffix from structs.
- `blinksy-esp` RMT driver expects `RMT_BUFFER_SIZE`.
  - Each memory block on the RMT driver has a size of 64, with a max of 8 memory blocks.
  - If async, you should use `64`.
  - If blocking and not too many LEDs, you should use `rmt_buffer_size::<Led>(Layout::PIXEL_COUNT)`.
  - If blocking and too many LEDs, you should use `64`.

- [#82](https://github.com/ahdinosaur/blinksy/pull/82): Use pixels buffer
  - Write all colors from `Pattern` iterator to pixel buffer, then write pixel buffer to LEDs with `Driver`.

## 0.10

Yee haw `blinksy` now supports async!

Migration guide (0.9 -> 0.10)

- You can now add the `async` feature and use async drivers.
  - For `gledopto`, add the `embassy` feature and use the `embassy_main` entry.
  - See examples for async usage.
- For projects using `gledopto` macros: no known breaking changes.
- For projects using `blinksy-esp`: `create_rmt_buffer!` macro no longer needs $num_leds.
- For projects using `blinksy` internals, changes:
  - Renamed `dimensions` module to `markers`
    - `dimension::Dim1d` -> `markers::Dim1d`
    - `dimension::Dim2d` -> `markers::Dim2d`
  - Move `dimension::LayoutForDim` to `layout::LayoutForDim`
  - Un-pub-ify internal functions within drivers

        let mut control = ControlBuilder::new_1d()
            .with_layout::<Layout>()
            .with_pattern::<Pattern>(PatternParams::default())
            .with_driver(driver)
            .build();
